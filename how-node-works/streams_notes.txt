streams are used to process(read and write) the data piece by piece(chunks),
without completing the whole read or write operation,
and therefore without keeping all the data in memory. 

we will read the piece of data and process somthing with it and freeup the memory
and repeate the process think of video streaming platforms like youtube and netflix work like this
they process the video into chunks so that we can watch the video before the whole video is downloaded

so that the streams are perfect to handling the large volume of data for example video,

more efficient for data processing in terms of memory and time because no need to kell all data in memory and 
we don't need to wait until the all data is available.

In node.js there are four types of streams
-Readable streams
-Writeable streams
-Duplex streams
-Transform streams
